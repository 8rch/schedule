# About the content of this file
# Table.js
This is a JavaScript code written using the React library for building user interfaces. It defines a component named Schedule that renders a table with rows and columns for each day of the week. Each row represents a different part of the day, such as "Morning UpStairs" or "Lunch A". Each cell in the table is a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a value from a list of options.

The component uses the useState hook to define two pieces of state: rows and x1Counts. rows is an array of objects that represent each row in the table. Each object has an id property and a values property that contains an object with properties for each day of the week. x1Counts is an object that keeps track of how many times the value "x1" has been selected for each day of the week.

The Schedule component defines two functions: addRow and handleChange. addRow adds a new row to the rows state array by creating a new object with default values and using the setRows function to update the state. handleChange is called when the user selects a new value from one of the dropdown menus. It updates the values property of the corresponding row object in the rows state array and also updates the x1Counts state object based on the new value that was selected.

The Schedule component renders a table with two rows: a header row and a body row. The header row contains a cell for each day of the week, and the body row contains a cell for each row in the rows state array. Each cell in the table body is a dropdown menu that is bound to the corresponding value in the values property of the row object in the rows state array. The x1Counts object is used to display the number of times the value "x1" has been selected for each day of the week in the header row.

#App.js

This is a React component that renders a table with columns for each day of the week and rows for each user. The table is created using the useTable hook from the react-table library, and the data is provided in the component state using the useState hook.

The component also includes an input field in the Monday column of each row, which allows the user to edit the schedule for that day. The handleMondayChange function updates the data in the component state with the new value entered by the user.

Finally, the component also includes a separate Schedule component, which is comming from Table.js

### ---> commands

### `yarn start`/'npm start'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
